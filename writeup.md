## Project: Search and Sample Return

---


**The goals / steps of this project are the following:**  

**Training / Calibration**  

* Download the simulator and take data in "Training Mode"
* Test out the functions in the Jupyter Notebook provided
* Add functions to detect obstacles and samples of interest (golden rocks)
* Fill in the `process_image()` function with the appropriate image processing steps (perspective transform, color threshold etc.) to get from raw images to a map.  The `output_image` you create in this step should demonstrate that your mapping pipeline works.
* Use `moviepy` to process the images in your saved dataset with the `process_image()` function.  Include the video you produce as part of your submission.

**Autonomous Navigation / Mapping**

* Fill in the `perception_step()` function within the `perception.py` script with the appropriate image processing functions to create a map and update `Rover()` data (similar to what you did with `process_image()` in the notebook).
* Fill in the `decision_step()` function within the `decision.py` script with conditional statements that take into consideration the outputs of the `perception_step()` in deciding how to issue throttle, brake and steering commands.
* Iterate on your perception and decision function until your rover does a reasonable (need to define metric) job of navigating and mapping.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/916/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it!

### Notebook Analysis
#### 1. Run the functions provided in the notebook on test images (first with the test data provided, next on data you have recorded). Add/modify functions to allow for color selection of obstacles and rock samples.

##### Perspective transform
I have modified `perspect_trasform()` to return mask along with warped image following **the walkthrough**. Because precision of warped image is reduced in proportion to distance, I've decided to clip it with radius of 120. It gives higher fidelity afterwards.
```python
# mask with radius
radius = 120
Y, X = np.ogrid[:img.shape[0], :img.shape[1]]
dist_from_center = np.sqrt((X - img.shape[1]/2)**2 + (Y-img.shape[0])**2)
mask = mask & (dist_from_center <= radius)
```

##### Coordinate transformation
I've only used navigable angles with shorter than 40 meters in distance to decide where to head. It gives better steering in case of avoiding obstacles.
```python
# Extract angles with shorter than 40 meters in distance
angles = np.extract(dist < 40, angles)
mean_dir = np.mean(angles)
```

For rest of the things, I've followed **the walkthrough** and it performed quite well.

#### 1. Populate the `process_image()` function with the appropriate analysis steps to map pixels identifying navigable terrain, obstacles and rock samples into a worldmap.  Run `process_image()` on your test data using the `moviepy` functions provided to create video output of your result.
I've followed **the walkthrough** and it performed quite well. The result is as below.

### Autonomous Navigation and Mapping

#### 1. Fill in the `perception_step()` (at the bottom of the `perception.py` script) and `decision_step()` (in `decision.py`) functions in the autonomous mapping scripts and an explanation is provided in the writeup of how and why these functions were modified as they were.


#### 2. Launching in autonomous mode your rover can navigate and map autonomously.  Explain your results and how you might improve them in your writeup.  

**Note: running the simulator with different choices of resolution and graphics quality may produce different results, particularly on different machines!  Make a note of your simulator settings (resolution and graphics quality set on launch) and frames per second (FPS output to terminal by `drive_rover.py`) in your writeup when you submit the project so your reviewer can reproduce your results.**

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
